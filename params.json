Contact Alex Zvoleff or see the `pyabm website \r\n<http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/pyabm>`_ for more details. A Python 3 \r\ncompatible version of pyabm is in the works, and should be released by summer \r\n2013.\r\n\r\nSee the `pyabm website <http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/pyabm>`_ for \r\nmore information, past releases, publications, and recent presentations.\r\n\r\nGetting the Code\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nStable releases of pyabm are available from the `Python Package Index \r\n(PyPI) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyabm>`_.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the code (unstable) is available as a `zipped snapshot \r\nfrom Github <https://github.com/azvoleff/pyabm/zipball/master>`_.\r\n\r\nYou can also `browse the source at GitHub \r\n<https://github.com/azvoleff/pyabm>`_.\r\n\r\nThe source can also be downloaded via git from::\r\n\r\n    git://github.com/azvoleff/pyabm.git\r\n\r\nAuthor Contact Information\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n| Alex Zvoleff\r\n| SDSU/UCSB Joint Doctoral Candidate\r\n| Department of Geography\r\n| San Diego State University\r\n| 5500 Campanile Dr.\r\n| San Diego, CA 92182-4493\r\n| Email: azvoleff@mail.sdsu.edu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
